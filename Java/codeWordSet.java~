   The codeword set consists of a context set and a symbol 'a', which is the symbol that has just
   been added to the symbol list. Every context in the context set stop being a context when
   extended with the 'a', and hence becomes a codeword.
   When the appropriate number of contexts have been added to the context set, the 'a'-extensions
   can be moved as codewords to the suffix tree by a method call.
